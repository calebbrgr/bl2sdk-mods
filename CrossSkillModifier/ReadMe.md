# Borderlands 2 - Cross Skill Modifier

### Fork of: *https://github.com/bl-sdk/PythonSDK/blob/master/Mods/SkillRandomizer/__init__.py*

## To use:

1. Open the \__init__.py file.

2. Modify a Tree variable (line 54) to make a tree of your liking. You can find all the skill names below this part. Personally I pulled up https://bl2skills.com/ and once I found a skill I liked I searched for it in the document and added it to the array.
3. Once you have created your tree make sure to modify the CurrentTree variable (line 66) to select what tree you want activated. (Tree_0 by default)

4. Place ./CrossSkillModifier in your PythonSDK Mods folder if you haven't already.

Enjoy!
