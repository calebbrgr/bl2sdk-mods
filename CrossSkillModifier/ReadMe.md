# Borderlands 2 - Cross Skill Modifier

### Fork of: *https://github.com/bl-sdk/PythonSDK/blob/master/Mods/SkillRandomizer/__init__.py*

## To use:

1. Open the __init__.py file.

2. Modify the Tree variables (line 52) to make a tree of your liking. You can find all the skill names below this part. Personally I pulled up https://bl2skills.com/ and once I found a skill I liked I searched for it in the document and added it to the array.
3. Once you have created your tree make sure to modify the CurrentTree variable (line 69) to select what tree you want activated. (Tree_1 by default)

4. Place in your PythonSDK mod folder if you haven't already.

Enjoy!
